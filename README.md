This project was intended to explore the idea of generating simple CRUD APIs from user-provided JSON files. While it demonstrates some functionality and potential, it is not fully polished or feature-complete. The project was not continued due to a lack of energy to pursue it further. Feel free to explore, copy, experiment with, and modify the code as you see fit.
